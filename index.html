        <span>🔬</span>The Science Behind the Myth** <br>
        Brain scans prove we use most of our brain daily. <br>
        MRI technology shows that even during simple tasks like walking, talking, <br>
        or even sleeping, multiple brain regions are active. <br>
         The brain is a highly interconnected organ, <br>
         and different parts work together to process information,<br> 
        control movements, and generate thoughts. <br>
        **If we only used 10%, brain damage wouldn’t affect us <br>
        but even small injuries can have serious effects, <br>
        proving every part of the brain has a function. <br>
        For example, damage to specific areas can lead to loss of speech, <br>
        memory problems,or difficulty in motor functions, <br>
        showing that nearly every region plays an essential role. <br>
        Evolution wouldn't have given us such a large brain if we didn’t need it! <br>
        The brain uses about 20% of our body’s total energy <br>
        making it one of the most energy-consuming organs.  <br>
        If we only needed 10%, evolution would have likely <br>

         reduced its size over time to conserve energy. <br>
        Neuroscientists confirm that all areas of the brain have a purpose. <br>
        Though some neurons may not always be firing simultaneously, <br>
        every part is used for different functions, from emotions <br>
        and decision-making to basic survival instincts. <br>

       <span> 📜 </span>Where Did This Myth Come From?<br>
        - The myth may have originated from a misinterpretation <br>
        of early 20th-century neurological studies. <br>
        Some researchers observed that a large portion <br>
         of the brain’s neurons were not <br>
        always active at once, leading to the false assumption that <br>
         we only "use" 10% at any given time. <br>
        In the 1890s, psychologist William James suggested that people only <br>
        "tap into a small fraction of their potential," but his words <br>
        were misquoted over time to mean that we use <br>
        only 10% of our actual brainpower. <br>
        Hollywood helped spread the idea with movies like Lucy (2014) <br>
        and Limitless (2011), where characters unlock superpowers <br>
        by accessing more than 10% of their brains. <br>
        While entertaining, these films reinforced a  <br>
        misconception that has no scientific backing. <br>
        The media, motivational speakers, and self-improvement <br>
        industries have also perpetuated this myth, 
        often using it as a way to suggest <br>
        that people have "hidden potential" waiting to be unlocked. <br>
         While we all have room for growth, <br>
        it’s not because 90% of our brains are sitting unused! <br>

    <span>🧠</span>How Our Brain Actually Works <br>
        - The brain is made up of different lobes, <br>
        each responsible for various functions. For example: <br>
          - The frontal lobe controls reasoning, decision-making, <br>
          and problem-solving. <br>
          - The parietal lobe processes sensory information <br>
          like touch and spatial awareness. <br>
          - The temporal lobe is involved in memory, language, <br>
           and auditory processing. <br>
          - The occipital lobe handles vision and image recognition. <br>
        - Each of these lobes works continuously, even when we sleep.  <br>
        Studies have shown that during deep sleep, <br>
         the brain remains highly active, <br>
         organizing memories and performing essential functions. <br>
