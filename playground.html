        ðŸ”¬ The Science Behind the Myth** <br>
        Brain scans prove we use most of our brain daily. <br>
        MRI technology shows that even during simple tasks like walking, talking, <br>
        or even sleeping, multiple brain regions are active. The brain is a highly <br>
        interconnected organ, and different parts work together to process information,<br> 
        control movements, and generate thoughts.- **If we only used 10%, brain damage wouldnâ€™t affect us <br>
        but even small injuries can have serious effects, proving every part of the brain has a function. <br>
        For example, damage to specific areas can lead to loss of speech, memory problems, <br>
        or difficulty in motor functions, showing that nearly every region plays an essential role. <br>
        Evolution wouldn't have given us such a large brain if we didnâ€™t need it! <br>
        The brain uses about 20% of our bodyâ€™s total energy <br>
        making it one of the most energy-consuming organs.  <br>
        If we only needed 10%, evolution would have likely reduced its size over time to conserve energy. <br>
        Neuroscientists confirm that all areas of the brain have a purpose. <br>
        Though some neurons may not always be firing simultaneously, <br>
        every part is used for different functions, from emotions and decision-making to basic survival instincts.

        ðŸ“œ Where Did This Myth Come From?
        - The myth may have originated from a misinterpretation <br>
        of early 20th-century neurological studies. Some researchers <br>
        observed that a large portion of the brainâ€™s neurons were not <br>
        always active at once, leading to the false assumption that we only "use" 10% at any given time. <br>
        In the 1890s, psychologist William James suggested that people only <br>
        "tap into a small fraction of their potential," but his words <br>
        were misquoted over time to mean that we use only 10% of our actual brainpower. <br>
        Hollywood helped spread the idea with movies like Lucy (2014) and <br>
        Limitless (2011), where characters unlock superpowers by accessing more <br>
        than 10% of their brains. While entertaining, these films reinforced a  <br>
        misconception that has no scientific backing. <br>
        The media, motivational speakers, and self-improvement <br>
        industries have also perpetuated this myth, often using it as a way to suggest <br>
        that people have "hidden potential" waiting to be unlocked. While we all have room for growth, <br>
        itâ€™s not because 90% of our brains are sitting unused! <br>

            ðŸ§  How Our Brain Actually Works <br>
            - The brain is made up of different lobes, <br>
            each responsible for various functions. For example: <br>
              - The frontal lobe controls reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving. <br>
              - The parietal lobe processes sensory information like touch and spatial awareness. <br>
              - The temporal lobe is involved in memory, language, and auditory processing. <br>
              - The occipital lobe handles vision and image recognition. <br>
            - Each of these lobes works continuously, even when we sleep.  <br>
            Studies have shown that during deep sleep, the brain remains highly active, <br>
             organizing memories and performing essential functions. <br>
